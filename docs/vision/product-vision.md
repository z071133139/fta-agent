# Product Vision

## The Problem

Finance transformation projects in the insurance industry follow a well-established consulting model: teams of consultants manually gather requirements, document processes, design target operating models, and produce deliverables. This work is:

- **Repetitive across engagements** -- the same patterns, questions, and frameworks apply to most insurance finance transformations
- **Heavily dependent on individual experience** -- quality varies based on which consultant is on the engagement
- **Manual and slow** -- consultants spend the majority of their time gathering, assembling, and formatting rather than advising
- **Siloed** -- knowledge lives in individual laptops, emails, and slide decks; it doesn't compound across the team or across engagements

## The Vision

The Finance Transformation Agent (FTA) reimagines how consultants deliver finance transformation projects in the insurance industry. It is not a tool that assists consultants -- it is an agent that changes what consultants do.

**Shift:** From consultants who gather, assemble, and format → to consultants who steer, validate, and advise.

The agent handles the analytical and synthesis work. The consultant applies judgment, manages relationships, and makes decisions.

## Value Proposition

### For the Consultant
- Compress early-phase timelines
- Produce higher-quality, more consistent deliverables
- Focus on high-value advisory work instead of document assembly
- Maintain full context across all workstreams without manual effort

### For the Client
- Faster time to deliverables
- More consistent quality regardless of which consultant is assigned
- Living documentation that stays current throughout the engagement
- Design artifacts that are directly traceable to implementation

### For the Firm
- Higher consultant leverage (fewer people, same or better output)
- Reusable domain knowledge that compounds across engagements
- Differentiated offering in a competitive market

## Target Users

### Primary: Finance Transformation Consultants
Consultants working on the design phase of insurance finance transformation projects. They interact with the agent daily to perform their work.

### Secondary: Engagement Leads
Senior consultants or managers who oversee the engagement, manage the backlog, and ensure quality. They use the agent for planning, tracking, and cross-workstream visibility.

### Future: Client Stakeholders
Insurance company finance teams who may interact with certain outputs or even directly with the agent in later phases.

## Rollout Strategy

| Phase | Audience | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Phase 1 | Personal use | Build the product as user zero; validate core workflows |
| Phase 2 | Super testers | Small group of trusted consultants; gather feedback, validate multi-user flows |
| Phase 3 | Broad rollout | Scale to consulting teams; add auth, multi-tenancy, billing |

## Industry Focus

- **Primary:** Insurance (life, P&C, reinsurance, health)
- **Domain:** Finance transformation -- GL design, close process, regulatory reporting, TOM, data migration
- **ERP platforms:** SAP-first (S/4HANA), with architecture supporting Oracle and Workday in the future

## What This Is NOT

- Not a generic AI chatbot with finance knowledge
- Not a traditional project management or delivery platform with AI features bolted on
- Not a replacement for consultants -- it is a force multiplier
- Not a template library -- outputs are generated dynamically from structured engagement context
