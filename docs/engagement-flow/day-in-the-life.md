# Day in the Life: How Consultants Use FTA

> Status: Ideation

## Engagement Setup

A finance transformation engagement with an insurance client. 5 consultants are working on the design phase. They share a backlog managed by the agent and all contribute to the same engagement context.

## Scenario: COA Workshop Day

### Without FTA (Today)

1. Consultant goes to a COA workshop with business stakeholders
2. Takes notes in a notebook or laptop
3. Goes back to desk, cleans up notes manually
4. Extracts action items, decisions, open questions by hand
5. Updates a requirements tracker (Excel/Jira) manually
6. Builds a readout deck in PowerPoint manually
7. Emails it around
8. Other consultants have no visibility until the email lands

Every step is manual. Every consultant does it differently. Knowledge lives in individual laptops.

### With FTA

1. Consultant goes to a COA workshop with business stakeholders
2. Feeds raw notes (typed, voice transcript, photo of whiteboard) into the agent
3. Agent automatically:
   - Structures the notes into decisions, open items, requirements
   - Updates the shared engagement context (every other consultant sees it immediately)
   - Links COA-related findings to the GL Design Coach's working model
   - Generates a client-ready readout deck
4. Consultant reviews, adjusts, sends

**Time saved:** The majority of the post-workshop administrative work is eliminated.
**Quality gained:** Structured, consistent, traceable outputs instead of ad-hoc notes.

## Multi-Consultant Dynamics

All 5 consultants feed into the same engagement context throughout the day:

- **The lead** asks the agent: "Summarize everything the team captured today"
- **Consultant B** (working on close process design) is automatically notified that Consultant A's workshop surfaced a subledger requirement that affects her workstream
- **No duplication:** The agent flags when a requirement has already been captured: "This was already documented by Consultant A yesterday -- should I merge or keep separate?"

## Switching Between Agents

Throughout the day, a consultant naturally switches contexts:

| Time | Task | Agent/Tool |
|------|------|------------|
| 9:00 | Review backlog, plan the day | Consulting Agent |
| 9:30 | COA workshop with business | (In meeting) |
| 11:00 | Document workshop findings | Consulting Agent (Requirements + Process Docs) |
| 11:30 | Design target natural accounts | GL Design Coach |
| 13:00 | Create client readout | Consulting Agent (Deck Builder) |
| 14:00 | Work on segment hierarchy design | GL Design Coach |
| 15:30 | Update requirements based on new findings | Consulting Agent (Requirements) |
| 16:00 | End of day summary for the lead | Consulting Agent |

The consultant switches explicitly. The context stays connected. The GL Design Coach knows what came out of the morning workshop because it's in the shared engagement context.

## The Lead's View

The engagement lead doesn't attend every workshop or work on every task. But through the agent, they have full visibility:

- "What did the team accomplish this week?"
- "Are there any cross-workstream conflicts?"
- "What's blocked?"
- "Generate a steering committee update deck"

The agent synthesizes across all consultants and all workstreams.

## Open Questions

- [ ] What is the optimal input method for raw notes? (Text paste, file upload, voice recording, photo?)
- [ ] How real-time is the engagement context update? (Immediate vs. batch?)
- [ ] How does the agent handle conflicting information from different consultants?
- [ ] What does the lead's dashboard/view look like?
