## PA-01: Chart of Accounts & Organizational Structure

### Insurance Relevance

Insurers require a CoA that simultaneously supports statutory accounting (SAP/STAT), US GAAP, and potentially IFRS 17 reporting from a single transaction set. The organizational hierarchy must accommodate legal entities, insurance pools, statutory lines of business (as defined by NAIC Annual Statement instructions), and regulatory jurisdictions. Unlike manufacturing, the CoA must natively encode accident year, policy year, and underwriting year dimensions that cut across the standard calendar reporting period.

### Segment Applicability

- **P&C: Always** — Multiple statutory LOBs (NAIC Exhibit of Premiums & Losses lines 1-35), accident year dimensions, Schedule P/Schedule F segmentation requirements.
- **Life/Annuity: Always** — Product-line segmentation (traditional life, UL, VUL, fixed annuity, variable annuity, indexed annuity), LDTI cohort dimensions, separate account vs. general account distinction.
- **Reinsurance: Always** — Treaty-level dimensions, retrocession layering, cedant hierarchy, and assumed vs. ceded differentiation create additional CoA complexity.

### Standard Sub-Processes

**SP-01.1: CoA Design & Multi-Basis Structure**
Design of the natural account structure to support parallel ledger postings: STAT accounts per NAIC requirements (matching Annual Statement line items), GAAP overlay accounts for DAC, goodwill, deferred tax, and IFRS 17 accounts for CSM, risk adjustment, and insurance revenue. Includes gap analysis between current chart and target reporting requirements.

- Segment variations: P&C charts typically have 800–2,000 natural accounts driven by Schedule P granularity. Life charts are larger (1,500–3,000+) due to product-line and reserve-type proliferation. Reinsurers often maintain cedant-attributed dimensions that expand effective chart size significantly.
- Scope: Almost always in scope — this is the foundation.
- Complexity: **High**

**SP-01.2: Entity & Company Code Structure**
Mapping legal entities to ERP company codes, defining intercompany relationships, and aligning with state licensing, NAIC group structure, and holding company requirements. Must accommodate insurance pooling agreements where multiple entities share risk.

- Segment variations: P&C groups often have 3–15 licensed carriers across states. Life groups may have fewer entities but with separate account complexity. Reinsurers may have single-entity structures but with branch accounting for international operations.
- Scope: Almost always in scope.
- Complexity: **Medium**

**SP-01.3: Profit Center / Segment / LOB Hierarchy**
Design of the dimensional model for LOB, product, and geographic attribution. Must simultaneously serve NAIC annual statement LOB definitions, internal management reporting segments, ASC 280 segment disclosures, and operational underwriting hierarchies. Insurance LOB structures are regulatory-defined and do not always align with how the company manages the business.

- Segment variations: P&C — NAIC defines ~35 statutory LOBs (Schedule P lines); companies typically map to 8–15 management LOBs. Life — product-type hierarchy with LDTI cohort overlays. Reinsurance — treaty type (QS, XOL, surplus), class of business, and cedant as key dimensions.
- Scope: Almost always in scope.
- Complexity: **High** — The most contentious design decision. Balancing statutory requirements with management desires creates significant stakeholder tension.

**SP-01.4: Accounting Basis Configuration (Parallel Ledgers)**
Configuration of parallel ledger/accounting basis infrastructure to post one transaction and derive STAT, GAAP, and IFRS 17 values. Includes definition of adjustment-only basis for GAAP and IFRS overlays, and the ledger group structure that drives reporting.

- Segment variations: Complexity is similar across segments but the specific adjustment entries differ. Life/Annuity LDTI adjustments are the most complex. Reinsurers with Solvency II add a fourth basis.
- Scope: Almost always in scope.
- Complexity: **High** — SAP extension ledger approach vs. Oracle multi-GAAP subledger vs. Workday workarounds are fundamental architectural decisions.

### Cross-Process Dependencies

Foundation for all other process areas. Directly consumed by PA-02 (GL), PA-15 (Close), PA-16 (Statutory), PA-17 (GAAP), PA-19 (Management Reporting). Organizational structure drives PA-11 (Intercompany) and PA-14 (Expense Allocation).

### ERP Notes

- **SAP S/4HANA:** Strong multi-ledger support via leading/extension ledgers in ACDOCA. Profit center and segment are core dimensions. Insurance-specific configurations available through FS-CD account determination. CoA can be shared across company codes (group chart of accounts). ACDOCA single-table approach can create performance considerations with very high-volume posting scenarios. SAP Best Practice scope item J58 (Insurance) provides starter CoA but requires significant extension.
- **Oracle Cloud ERP:** Primary and secondary ledgers support multi-basis. Segment-based CoA flexfield design is flexible but requires careful planning. Oracle Subledger Accounting (SLA) provides powerful posting rules. No insurance-specific content pack; CoA must be designed from scratch.
- **Workday Financials:** Worktag-based dimensional model is inherently flexible but the single-ledger architecture makes true multi-basis accounting challenging. Workarounds involve reporting dimensions and calculated fields. Not typically chosen for complex insurance multi-basis requirements.

### Common Scoping Decisions

1. **Parallel ledger architecture:** Leading ledger as STAT vs. GAAP, and how many extension/secondary ledgers to maintain.
2. **LOB granularity:** Whether to implement at NAIC statutory LOB level, management LOB level, or both — and how to map between them.
3. **Accident year/policy year dimension:** Whether to carry these as GL dimensions or handle in sub-ledgers/reporting tools.
4. **Pooling representation:** Whether pool members are separate company codes or handled through allocation logic.

## PA-02: General Ledger & Multi-Basis Accounting

### Insurance Relevance

The insurance GL is structurally different because it must simultaneously maintain books on two or three accounting bases (US STAT, US GAAP, IFRS) that have fundamentally different recognition and measurement rules for the same transactions. STAT follows NAIC SAP; GAAP follows ASC 944 (short-duration) or ASC 944 long-duration with LDTI modifications; IFRS 17 uses a completely different measurement model. The GL must reconcile between these bases and support close processes driven by regulatory filing deadlines.

### Segment Applicability

- **P&C: Always** — Dual-basis (STAT/GAAP) is the minimum; many also track tax basis.
- **Life/Annuity: Always** — Triple-basis (STAT/GAAP/Tax) is common; LDTI has fundamentally changed the GAAP overlay. Global carriers add IFRS 17.
- **Reinsurance: Always** — Similar multi-basis needs plus Solvency II for European operations.

### Standard Sub-Processes

**SP-02.1: Journal Entry Processing**
Posting of standard, recurring, and manual journal entries across all accounting bases. Insurance-specific journals include reserve postings from actuarial systems, premium accruals from policy admin, investment income accruals, and reinsurance settlement entries. Many originate from sub-ledger interfaces (PA-20) rather than manual entry.

- Scope: Almost always in scope.
- Complexity: **Medium** — Challenge is volume and automated journal sources, not the posting mechanism.

**SP-02.2: Multi-Basis Posting & Adjustment Logic**
Engine that takes a single economic event and produces correct entries on each accounting basis. A loss reserve strengthening might post identically on STAT and GAAP for P&C, but for Life under LDTI, the GAAP entry involves CSM/RA adjustments that differ entirely from the STAT posting. Tax basis may require Section 846 discount adjustments.

- Segment variations: P&C — STAT/GAAP differences are relatively narrow (DAC, goodwill, certain investments). Life — LDTI creates massive STAT-GAAP divergence for long-duration contracts. Reinsurance — additional basis for retrocession netting.
- Scope: Almost always in scope.
- Complexity: **High**

**SP-02.3: Period-End Accrual & Allocation Processing**
Systematic accruals unique to insurance: earned premium accrual, loss reserve accrual/development, LAE accrual, commission accrual, policyholder dividend accrual, and investment income accrual. Each follows insurance-specific recognition patterns that do not map to standard revenue/expense accrual templates.

- Scope: Almost always in scope.
- Complexity: **High**

**SP-02.4: Currency & Foreign Exchange Processing**
Multi-currency postings for international operations, reinsurance in foreign currencies, and investment portfolios with foreign-denominated securities. Requires remeasurement (STAT) and translation (consolidation) with insurance-specific rules around loss reserves denominated in claim-payment currencies.

- Segment variations: P&C — moderate FX exposure (international casualty, global programs). Life — lower unless variable products with international funds. Reinsurance — very high, most global reinsurers transact in 10+ currencies.
- Scope: In scope for international carriers. Domestic-only may defer.
- Complexity: **Medium-High** for global carriers

**SP-02.5: GL Reconciliation & Control**
Sub-ledger to GL reconciliation for all feeder systems: policy admin (premium), claims (losses), actuarial (reserves), investment (portfolio), reinsurance (ceded/assumed). Insurance GL reconciliation is harder than other industries because the number of sub-ledgers is larger and the posting logic is more complex.

- Scope: Almost always in scope.
- Complexity: **High** — This is where data quality issues surface.

### Cross-Process Dependencies

Depends on PA-01 (CoA). Consumes postings from PA-03 through PA-08 and PA-10 through PA-14. Feeds PA-15 (Close), PA-16 (Statutory), PA-17 (GAAP), PA-19 (Management Reporting).

### ERP Notes

- **SAP S/4HANA:** Universal Journal (ACDOCA) is the core. Extension ledgers handle STAT vs. GAAP vs. IFRS 17 adjustment-only postings. Real-time consolidation via Group Reporting. FPSL (Financial Products Subledger) is SAP's insurance sub-ledger for high-volume policy/claims accounting — key architectural decision whether to use FPSL or direct GL posting. Document splitting by profit center/segment is native.
- **Oracle Cloud ERP:** Primary/secondary ledger with SLA rules engine. Strong journal approval workflows. Reporting currency ledgers for FX. Lacks insurance-specific posting templates; must be configured via SLA rules. Fusion GL performance generally strong at scale.
- **Workday Financials:** Single-ledger architecture requires creative use of worktags and custom reports for multi-basis. Not recommended as primary GL for complex insurance multi-basis. Increasingly used as corporate/holding company GL with insurance sub-ledgers feeding in.

### Common Scoping Decisions

1. **FPSL vs. direct GL posting (SAP):** Whether to route insurance sub-ledger activity through FPSL or post directly to ACDOCA — major architectural fork.
2. **Number of accounting bases:** STAT + GAAP minimum; whether to add tax basis and/or IFRS 17 as separate ledgers or derive through reporting.
3. **Journal automation target:** What percentage of journals should be fully automated at go-live vs. manual/template during stabilization.

## PA-03: Premium Accounting & Revenue Recognition

### Insurance Relevance

Premium is the primary revenue stream for insurers, and its accounting has no parallel in other industries. Written premium must be allocated to earned and unearned components using methods that vary by LOB, policy structure, and accounting basis. The UPR (unearned premium reserve) as a liability — cash collected but risk not yet borne — is unique to insurance. Retrospective rating, audit premium, reinstatement premium, and multi-year policy handling add layers that standard ASC 606 revenue recognition does not address.

### Segment Applicability

- **P&C: Always** — Premium is the core revenue; earned premium calculation methods (pro-rata daily, Rule of 78s, monthly pro-rata) vary by LOB and policy type.
- **Life/Annuity: Always** — Fundamentally different. Gross premium vs. net premium valuation distinction under LDTI. Single premium vs. flexible premium products. Premium is more akin to a deposit for some product types.
- **Reinsurance: Always** — Premium typically reported on a bordereau lag basis; minimum and deposit premium, reinstatement premium, and profit commission adjustments add complexity.

### Standard Sub-Processes

**SP-03.1: Gross Written Premium Recording**
Booking of premium from policy admin system at binding/inception. Includes new business, renewal, endorsement, and cancellation premium. Must be attributed to statutory LOB, accident year, treaty year (for reinsurance), and management dimensions at point of entry.

- Scope: Almost always in scope.
- Complexity: **Medium**

**SP-03.2: Earned Premium Calculation & UPR**
Calculation of the portion of written premium earned (risk expired) and the resulting UPR liability. Methods include daily pro-rata (most common for P&C), 24ths method, and exposure-based earning. UPR is the single largest liability on many P&C balance sheets. Under IFRS 17 PAA, this becomes the liability for remaining coverage.

- Scope: Almost always in scope for P&C. Life scope depends on product mix.
- Complexity: **High** for P&C.

**SP-03.3: Retrospective Rating & Audit Premium**
For large commercial accounts, premium is adjusted after the policy period based on actual loss experience (retro-rated) or actual exposure verification (audit premium). These adjustments span multiple accounting periods and require re-attribution to the original underwriting year.

- Scope: In scope for P&C commercial lines. Frequently deferred for personal lines-only carriers.
- Complexity: **High**

**SP-03.4: Installment Billing & Premium Receivable**
Processing of policyholder and agent premium billing, installment payment application, commission offset, and receivable aging.

- Scope: In scope for direct-bill carriers. Agency-bill carriers may handle outside the ERP.
- Complexity: **Medium**

**SP-03.5: Premium Deficiency Reserve**
When anticipated losses and expenses exceed remaining UPR plus future premium, a PDR is recognized. Requires actuarial coordination.

- Scope: Usually in scope for P&C as a close step.
- Complexity: **Low-Medium**

### ERP Notes

- **SAP S/4HANA:** FS-CD is the SAP insurance sub-ledger for premium accounting — handles premium billing, collections, and agent commission accounting. Significantly changes the architecture: premium does NOT flow through standard FI-AR. If FS-CD is in scope, premium accounting design is fundamentally different. SAP Best Practice for Insurance (J58) includes premium posting templates.
- **Oracle Cloud ERP:** No native premium accounting module. Premium typically posts to GL via interface from PAS. AR can be adapted for premium receivables but lacks earned premium logic.
- **Workday Financials:** No premium accounting capability. Premium postings interface from PAS.

---

## PA-04: Loss & Claims Accounting

### Insurance Relevance

Loss and LAE is the largest cost item for P&C insurers, typically 60–80% of earned premium. The accounting involves multiple estimation layers (case reserves, IBNR, ULAE) set by different functions (claims adjusters, actuaries) on different schedules. The actuarial-to-accounting interface is one of the most critical and error-prone integration points.

### Segment Applicability

- **P&C: Always** — This is the defining process for P&C insurance finance.
- **Life/Annuity: Sometimes** — Life claims (death benefits, annuity payments) follow simpler patterns. Health/disability lines have P&C-like reserve patterns.
- **Reinsurance: Always** — Assumed loss reserves follow the same IBNR/case structure but with cedant reporting lag and additional estimation uncertainty.

### Standard Sub-Processes

**SP-04.1: Paid Loss Recording** — Booking claims payments from claims system, classified by loss type, LOB, accident year. Scope: Almost always. Complexity: **Medium**

**SP-04.2: Case Reserve Accounting** — Recording individual claim reserves set by claims adjusters; high-frequency changes. Scope: Almost always for P&C. Complexity: **Medium-High**

**SP-04.3: IBNR & Bulk Reserve Posting** — Actuarially-determined reserves for IBNR, case development, and late-reported claims. Quarterly actuarial delivery. Scope: Almost always. Complexity: **High**

**SP-04.4: LAE & ULAE Accounting** — DCC (ALAE) per-claim and ULAE as actuarial bulk estimate. Schedule P disclosure. Scope: Almost always for P&C. Complexity: **Medium**

**SP-04.5: Subrogation & Salvage Recoveries** — Third-party recoveries that reduce net incurred losses. Scope: Usually for P&C. Complexity: **Low-Medium**

### ERP Notes

- **SAP S/4HANA:** FS-CD can handle claims payment processing. FPSL for loss reserve sub-ledger. Most insurers interface aggregate postings from claims system. SAP has no native IBNR calculation.
- **Oracle Cloud ERP:** No native loss accounting module. GL receives entries from claims and actuarial systems via SLA rules.
- **Workday Financials:** No loss accounting capability. Journal interface only.

---

## PA-05: Ceded Reinsurance Accounting

### Insurance Relevance

Ceded reinsurance creates a parallel set of accounting entries for every premium and loss transaction. Schedule F and reinsurance recoverables are areas of intense regulatory focus. STAT requires detailed tracking of recoverables by reinsurer with credit quality provisions.

### Segment Applicability

- **P&C: Always** — All but the smallest carriers have significant reinsurance programs.
- **Life/Annuity: Usually** — Coinsurance, YRT, and modco arrangements common for mortality risk.
- **Reinsurance: Always** — Retrocession follows the same logic.

### Standard Sub-Processes

**SP-05.1: Treaty & Facultative Setup** — Contract terms configuration. Scope: Almost always. Complexity: **High**

**SP-05.2: Ceded Premium Accounting** — QS percentage, XOL deposit, reinstatement premium. Scope: Almost always. Complexity: **High**

**SP-05.3: Ceded Loss & Reserve Recovery** — Per-occurrence and aggregate treaties. Ceded IBNR estimation. Scope: Almost always. Complexity: **High**

**SP-05.4: Ceding Commission Accounting** — Flat, sliding-scale, and profit commissions. Scope: Almost always. Complexity: **Medium-High**

**SP-05.5: Schedule F & Reinsurer Credit** — Recoverables by reinsurer, collateral offsets, unauthorized provision. Scope: Almost always for US-regulated carriers. Complexity: **High**

### ERP Notes

- **SAP S/4HANA:** FS-RI handles treaty setup, ceded premium/loss calculation, and reinsurer settlement. Without FS-RI, reinsurance stays in a dedicated system (SOLIS, GENIUS) with net entries to GL.
- **Oracle Cloud ERP:** No native module. Dedicated reinsurance system + interface standard.
- **Workday Financials:** No capability. Interface only.

---

## PA-06: Assumed Reinsurance Accounting

### Insurance Relevance

Driven by bordereaux received from cedants with significant lag. Revenue side for reinsurers; also appears for primary carriers in pools.

### Segment Applicability

- **P&C: Sometimes** — Primary carriers with pools or affiliate assumptions.
- **Life/Annuity: Sometimes** — Life assumed (coinsurance, modco) has unique reserve and DAC implications.
- **Reinsurance: Always** — Core business.

### Standard Sub-Processes

**SP-06.1: Bordereaux Processing & Reconciliation** — Intake, validation, posting of cedant statements. Scope: Always for reinsurers. Complexity: **High**

**SP-06.2: Assumed Premium Recognition** — Deposit, minimum, adjustable premium; periodic true-up. Scope: Always for reinsurers. Complexity: **Medium-High**

**SP-06.3: Assumed Reserve Estimation** — Case from bordereaux; IBNR with greater uncertainty. Scope: Always for reinsurers. Complexity: **High**

**SP-06.4: Funds Held / Funds Withheld Accounting** — Collateral arrangements; modco involves complex reserve-linked calculations. Scope: In scope when applicable. Complexity: **High** for modco.

---

## PA-07: Policyholder Liabilities & Reserves (Life/Annuity)

### Insurance Relevance

Specific to life/annuity. LDTI (effective 2025) has fundamentally changed GAAP accounting. STAT follows NAIC-prescribed methods (CRVM, CARVM). IFRS 17 adds a third measurement model. Most technically complex accounting area in insurance.

### Segment Applicability

- **P&C: Rarely** — Not applicable unless carrier has life/health subsidiary.
- **Life/Annuity: Always** — Defining process area.
- **Reinsurance: Sometimes** — For life assumed books.

### Standard Sub-Processes

**SP-07.1: Policy Reserve Calculation Interface** — Actuarial/valuation system to GL. LDTI: LFPB, LPAB, MRB. Scope: Always for Life. Complexity: **High**

**SP-07.2: DAC / VOBA / Unearned Revenue Accounting** — LDTI simplified DAC to constant-level basis but cohort tracking required. Scope: Always for Life GAAP. Complexity: **High**

**SP-07.3: Guaranteed Minimum Benefits (GMxB)** — MRB fair value measurement under LDTI. Scope: In scope for VA carriers. Complexity: **Very High**

**SP-07.4: Policyholder Dividend Accounting** — Par policy dividends; STAT/GAAP timing differences. Scope: For mutual companies and par products. Complexity: **Medium**

**SP-07.5: Separate Account Accounting** — Parallel balance sheet; daily NAV-based entries; fee income. Scope: For variable product carriers. Complexity: **High**

---

## PA-08: Investment Accounting Interface

### Insurance Relevance

Insurance companies are major institutional investors. STAT and GAAP use different measurement bases for the same securities. IMR and AVR are STAT-specific. Investment system is separate from GL (SimCorp, Charles River, Eagle).

### Segment Applicability

- **P&C: Always**
- **Life/Annuity: Always** — Largest portfolios; ALM critical.
- **Reinsurance: Always**

### Standard Sub-Processes

**SP-08.1: Investment Income Accrual** — Bond coupon, dividend, rental. STAT/GAAP attribution to LOB for Schedule T. Scope: Almost always. Complexity: **Medium**

**SP-08.2: Realized Gain/Loss** — STAT: IMR allocation for interest-related gains. GAAP: immediate recognition. Scope: Almost always. Complexity: **Medium-High**

**SP-08.3: Unrealized Gain/Loss & OTTI/CECL** — GAAP AFS in OCI; STAT AVR. Scope: Almost always. Complexity: **Medium-High**

**SP-08.4: Bond Amortization** — Scientific method (STAT); effective interest (GAAP). Scope: Almost always. Complexity: **Low-Medium**

**SP-08.5: Derivative & Hedge Accounting** — ASC 815 (GAAP); SSAP 86 (STAT). Scope: For material derivative portfolios. Complexity: **High**

---

## PA-09: Accounts Payable & Vendor Management

### Segment Applicability

---

## PA-10: Accounts Receivable & Premium Collections

### Segment Applicability

- **P&C: Always**
- **Life/Annuity: Usually**
- **Reinsurance: Always** — Cedant receivables are primary AR.

### Standard Sub-Processes

**SP-10.2: Direct Bill Collections** — Installment billing, payment application, grace period, non-payment cancellation. FS-CD purpose-built. Complexity: **Medium**

**SP-10.3: Premium Receivable Aging & Bad Debt** — Unique: unpaid premium → cancellation → UPR reversal offsets write-off. Complexity: **Medium**

**SP-10.4: Reinsurance Receivable Management** — For assumed: cedant receivables. For ceded: recoverable aging (Schedule F). Complexity: **Medium-High**

---

## PA-11: Intercompany & Pooling Arrangements

### Segment Applicability

- **P&C: Usually** — Pooling is very common for P&C groups.
- **Life/Annuity: Sometimes**

---

## PA-14: Expense Management & Cost Allocation

### Insurance Relevance

Regulatory requirement to classify all expenses into: LAE (DCC/A&O), other underwriting expense, and investment expense. The IEE (Exhibit 2) requires allocation of every dollar to LOB using prescribed methodologies. The expense ratio is a key combined ratio component.

### Segment Applicability: Always for all segments.

### Standard Sub-Processes

**SP-14.1: Expense Classification** — DCC/A&O, other underwriting, investment. Complexity: **Medium**

**SP-14.2: LOB & Segment Allocation** — IEE instruction compliance; cost drivers (premium volume, headcount, claims count). Complexity: **High** — Methodology design is contentious; statutory surplus implications.

**SP-14.3: DAC-Eligible Expense Identification** — GAAP deferral qualification. Complexity: **Medium**

**SP-14.4: IEE Production** — NAIC Exhibit 2; complete allocation to LOB and functional category. Complexity: **High**

### ERP Notes

- **SAP S/4HANA:** CO-CCA, CO-PA, SAP Allocation Management. IEE configuration is always custom.
- **Oracle Cloud ERP:** Oracle PCM Cloud is a strong allocation engine configurable for IEE.
- **Workday Financials:** Workday Allocations module; often insufficient for complex IEE.

---

## PA-15: Financial Close & Consolidation

### Insurance Relevance

Multiple accounting bases with different timelines (NAIC quarterly, SEC 10-Q, state-specific). Higher volume of estimate-based entries requiring actuarial coordination. Close sequence matters: STAT precedes GAAP. Industry average: 15–25 business days; transformation target: 10–12.

### Segment Applicability: Always for all segments.

### Standard Sub-Processes

**SP-15.1: Close Calendar & Task Management** — Actuarial deliverables are critical-path. Complexity: **Medium**

## PA-16: Statutory & Regulatory Reporting

### Insurance Relevance

The NAIC Annual Statement is a 100+ page prescribed-format report with 50+ schedules filed with every licensed state. Most insurance-specific process area. No other industry has an equivalent.

### Segment Applicability: Always for all segments.

### Standard Sub-Processes

**SP-16.1: Annual/Quarterly Statement Preparation** — GL and sub-ledger detail mapped to prescribed NAIC line items. Scope: Almost always; specialized tools required. Complexity: **High**

**SP-16.2: Schedule P Production (P&C)** — 10-year accident year loss development triangles by LOB. Complexity: **High** — Historical data continuity through migration is highest data risk.

**SP-16.3: Schedule F Production** — Recoverables by reinsurer, ceded premium, collateral. Complexity: **High**

**SP-16.4: Investment Schedule Production (A/B/BA/D/DA)** — NAIC investment schedules from investment system data. Complexity: **Medium**

**SP-16.5: RBC Calculation** — P&C or Life formula; comparison to total adjusted capital. Complexity: **Medium-High**

**SP-16.6: State Filing & UCAA** — Multi-state filings, state-specific supplements. Complexity: **Low-Medium**

**SP-16.7: Solvency II / International Regulatory** — QRTs, ORSA, local GAAP. Complexity: **Very High** for first-time implementation.

### ERP Notes

- **SAP S/4HANA:** Does not natively produce NAIC statements. Specialized tools required (WoltersKluwer, Clearwater).
- **Oracle Cloud ERP:** No native NAIC reporting. Third-party tools standard.
- **Workday Financials:** No statutory capability. Third-party required.

---

## PA-17: GAAP/IFRS External Reporting

### Segment Applicability

- **P&C: Always** (public companies)
- **Life/Annuity: Always** (public companies) — LDTI disclosures are extensive.
- **Reinsurance: Always** (public companies)

### Standard Sub-Processes

**SP-17.1: GAAP Financial Statement Production** — Insurance-specific line items: UPR, loss reserves net of RI, DAC, RI recoverables. Complexity: **Medium**

**SP-17.2: LDTI / IFRS 17 Disclosures** — LDTI: LFPB roll-forward, net premium ratio, MRB, DAC roll-forward. IFRS 17: CSM roll-forward, RA movement, insurance revenue disaggregation. Complexity: **Very High** for Life, **Medium** for P&C.

**SP-17.3: Segment Reporting (ASC 280 / IFRS 8)** — Operating segments that may cross-cut statutory LOBs. Complexity: **Medium**

**SP-17.4: EPS & Equity Roll-Forward** — AOCI (unrealized investment gains — often very large and volatile). Complexity: **Low-Medium**

---

## PA-18: Tax Accounting & Compliance

### Insurance Relevance

Subject to unique Subchapter L provisions: Section 846 (loss reserve discounting), Section 848 (DAC tax), Section 807 (Life reserves), Section 832 (P&C deductions). These create significant book-tax differences with no analog in other industries.

### Segment Applicability: Always for all segments.

### Standard Sub-Processes

**SP-18.1: Current Tax Provision (ASC 740)** — Section 846 discount adjustment, Section 848 DAC tax, municipal bond proration. Complexity: **High**

**SP-18.2: Deferred Tax Calculation** — STAT vs. discounted loss reserves, DAC GAAP vs. tax, UPR STAT vs. Rule 35. Complexity: **High**

**SP-18.3: State Premium Tax** — Rates by state/LOB, retaliatory provisions, Schedule T reconciliation. Complexity: **Medium**

**SP-18.4: Federal Tax Return Data Sourcing** — Form 1120-PC or 1120-L data. Complexity: **Medium** (data)

---

## PA-20: Data Integration & Sub-Ledger Interfaces

### Insurance Relevance

The GL is an aggregation point receiving from 5–10 upstream systems. Unlike other industries where the ERP is the primary system of record, insurance finance depends on a network of specialized sub-ledgers. Integration architecture is the connective tissue and often the highest-risk workstream.

### Segment Applicability: Always for all segments.

### Standard Sub-Processes

**SP-20.1: Policy Admin to GL Interface** — Premium, policy count, policyholder data. First interface designed. Complexity: **High**

**SP-20.2: Claims to GL Interface** — Paid losses, case reserves, LAE; accident year, LOB, cause of loss. Complexity: **High**

**SP-20.3: Actuarial to GL Interface** — IBNR, bulk, ULAE, policy reserves, LDTI adjustments. Low volume, high impact. Complexity: **Medium** (technical), **High** (business)

**SP-20.4: Investment to GL Interface** — Income, realized/unrealized, amortization, impairments; dual-basis. Complexity: **Medium-High**

**SP-20.5: Reinsurance System Interface** — Bidirectional. FS-RI makes this internal; otherwise external. Complexity: **High**

**SP-20.6: Integration Architecture & Middleware** — MuleSoft, Boomi, SAP Integration Suite; error handling, reconciliation checkpoints. Complexity: **High** — Where most time and budget is consumed.

### ERP Notes

- **SAP S/4HANA:** SAP Integration Suite (cloud), PI/PO (on-premise), FPSL as intermediate sub-ledger.
- **Oracle Cloud ERP:** Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC), SOA, FBDI, SLA for posting rule transformation.
- **Workday Financials:** Workday Integration Cloud, Studio, EIBs. Fewer insurance-specific connectors.

| PA-04 | Loss & Claims Accounting | The defining P&C process — paid losses, case reserves, IBNR, LAE/ULAE |
| PA-05 | Ceded Reinsurance | Essential — most P&C carriers have multi-layer programs |
| PA-14 | Expense Management | IEE (Exhibit 2) allocation is the most complex statutory expense requirement |
| PA-15 | Financial Close | Dual-basis close with actuarial reserve dependencies |
| PA-16 | Statutory Reporting | Annual/quarterly statements including Schedule P, Schedule F, IEE |
| PA-20 | Data Integration | PAS, claims, actuarial, investment, reinsurance interfaces |

### Common Additions — Frequently Added Based on Scope

| PA | Process Area | When Included |
|---|---|---|
| PA-09 | AP & Commission Payments | Almost always; depends on whether commission system is being replaced |
| PA-10 | AR & Premium Collections | Almost always for direct-bill; may exclude for pure agency-bill |
| PA-11 | Intercompany & Pooling | Included for groups with pool arrangements |
| PA-13 | Cash Management | Almost always; cat liquidity planning |
| PA-17 | GAAP External Reporting | For public companies |
| PA-18 | Tax Accounting | Usually; data sourcing for Section 846/832 provisions |
| PA-19 | Management Reporting | Frequently — combined ratio, reserve development dashboards |

### Rarely In Scope

| PA | Process Area | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| PA-07 | Policyholder Liabilities (Life) | Not applicable unless carrier has life/health subsidiary |
| PA-08 | Investment Accounting | Interface always in scope, but investment system replacement rarely part of ERP project |
| PA-12 | Fixed Assets & Leases | Standard, low-risk; sometimes deferred to later phase |

### P&C-Specific Process Areas

- **Schedule P production** requires 10-year accident year loss development triangles — the single most data-intensive statutory exhibit and the one most affected by system migration.
- **Retrospective rating and audit premium** create multi-year premium adjustments that are architecturally complex.
- **Catastrophe reserve accounting** — some P&C carriers maintain catastrophe reserves that require separate tracking.
- **Workers' compensation second-injury fund accounting** — state-specific WC surcharges and recoveries.

---

## Life/Annuity

### Core Process Areas — Virtually Always In Scope

| PA | Process Area | Life/Annuity Notes |
|---|---|---|
| PA-01 | CoA & Org Structure | Product-type hierarchy, LDTI cohort dimensions, separate account vs. general account |
| PA-02 | GL & Multi-Basis | STAT/GAAP/Tax minimum; LDTI creates massive GAAP overlay complexity |
| PA-07 | Policyholder Liabilities | The defining life process — LFPB, LPAB, MRB, DAC, VOBA, separate accounts |
| PA-08 | Investment Accounting Interface | Largest portfolios relative to revenue; ALM critical |
| PA-14 | Expense Management | Product-level expense allocation for unit cost and statutory |
| PA-15 | Financial Close | Triple-basis close with LDTI-specific steps |
| PA-16 | Statutory Reporting | Blue book with Exhibit 5 (reserves), Exhibit 6 (claims), asset schedules |
| PA-20 | Data Integration | Valuation/actuarial system interface is the most critical integration |

### Common Additions

| PA | Process Area | When Included |
|---|---|---|
| PA-03 | Premium Accounting | Different from P&C — deposit-like premium, premium modes, group billing |
| PA-05 | Ceded Reinsurance | Coinsurance, YRT, modco — complex with embedded derivative implications |
| PA-09 | AP & Commissions | First year/renewal/trail agent commissions |
| PA-10 | AR & Collections | Group billing, bank draft, direct bill |

### Life/Annuity-Specific Process Areas

- **LDTI implementation** — fundamentally changed GAAP accounting. Cohort design, remeasurement methodology, and new disclosures.
- **Separate account accounting** — parallel balance sheet/income statement with daily NAV-based entries.
- **Policyholder dividend accounting** — significant for mutual companies.
- **DAC/VOBA at cohort level** — product grouping decisions affect amortization patterns for decades.

---

## Reinsurance

### Core Process Areas — Virtually Always In Scope

| PA | Process Area | Reinsurance Notes |
|---|---|---|
| PA-01 | CoA & Org Structure | Treaty/cedant/class-of-business dimensions; retrocession layering |
| PA-02 | GL & Multi-Basis | Multi-basis plus potential Solvency II for European operations |
| PA-05 | Ceded Reinsurance | As retrocession — outward reinsurance to other reinsurers |
| PA-06 | Assumed Reinsurance | The core business — bordereaux processing, assumed reserves, cedant management |
| PA-10 | AR & Receivable Management | Cedant receivables are the primary AR category |
| PA-13 | Cash Management | Multi-currency settlement, collateral management |
| PA-14 | Expense Management | Expense allocation across assumed/ceded/operating |
| PA-15 | Financial Close | Complicated by cedant reporting lag |
| PA-16 | Statutory Reporting | Schedule S for assumed business; P&C or Life format |
| PA-20 | Data Integration | Bordereaux intake is the critical integration challenge |

### Reinsurance-Specific Process Areas

- **Bordereaux processing and automation** — the single biggest operational challenge.
- **Multi-currency accounting** — most global reinsurers transact in 10+ currencies.
- **Funds held/withheld accounting** — especially modco and funds-withheld retrocession.
- **Retrocession accounting** — an additional layer of ceded accounting.

# SECTION 4: Insurance-Specific Process Areas Not in Generic Finance Libraries

Generic ERP content (SAP Best Practice, Oracle Process Accelerators) is built for manufacturing and retail. The following process areas are absent or fundamentally different in generic libraries.

| # | Process Area | Key Insurance Gap | Segments |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4.1 | Premium Accounting & Earned Premium | UPR, earning curves, ASC 944 vs. ASC 606, retrospective rating | All |
| 4.2 | Loss Reserving (Case, IBNR, LAE, ULAE) | Multi-layer actuarial estimation with different functions and cadences | P&C, Reinsurance, Life (health) |
| 4.3 | Ceded Reinsurance Accounting | Parallel accounting stream mirroring treaty terms; no generic analog | All |
| 4.4 | Assumed Reinsurance Accounting | Bordereaux processing; cedant-reported data with inherent lag | Reinsurance, P&C pools |
| 4.5 | Claims Payment Accounting | Policy-term based disbursements; classification by accident year/LOB/cause | All |
| 4.6 | Policyholder Liability Accounting (Life) | LDTI, CRVM/CARVM, MRB, DAC/VOBA; actuarial science as accounting | Life/Annuity |
| 4.7 | Actuarial-to-Accounting Interface | Bidirectional data exchange driving largest balance sheet liabilities | All |
| 4.8 | Regulatory / Statutory Reporting | NAIC Annual Statement (50+ schedules), RBC, IRIS, Solvency II — no generic parallel | All |
| 4.9 | Loss Run & Schedule Production | External claim-level reports used by brokers/cedants for pricing | P&C, Reinsurance |
| 4.10 | Investment Accounting Interface | Dual-basis (STAT amortized / GAAP fair value); IMR/AVR; NAIC investment schedules | All |

---

# SECTION 5: Standard Scoping Questions per Process Area

---

## PA-01: Chart of Accounts & Organizational Structure

1. **How many statutory LOBs are you actively writing, and how do they map to your management LOBs?** — Reveals the gap between regulatory and management structures; drives CoA complexity.
2. **Do you have any intercompany pooling arrangements, and if so, what are the participation percentages and does membership change periodically?** — Pool accounting design; dynamic membership adds retroactive adjustment complexity.
3. **What is your approach to accident year / policy year tracking — in the GL or in sub-ledgers?** — Determines whether new CoA needs year dimensions. Major architectural decision.
4. **Which accounting basis do you want as the leading ledger — STAT or GAAP?** — Cascading impact on every downstream process. Costly to reverse.
5. **Are there any anticipated entity restructurings or pool changes in the next 3–5 years?** — CoA must accommodate future state.
6. **Do you have any state-specific reporting requirements beyond the NAIC standard (e.g., NY Regulation 30, Texas Lloyd's)?** — State specifics add dimensions and complexity not in NAIC standard.

---

## PA-03: Premium Accounting & Revenue Recognition

1. **Where does earned premium get calculated today — PAS, actuarial, data warehouse, or spreadsheets?** — Determines whether ERP needs to calculate earned premium or receive it. Gateway question for FS-CD scope.
2. **What percentage is agency-bill vs. direct-bill, and are you planning to change that mix?** — Drives FS-CD scope decision and overall receivables architecture.
3. **Do you write any multi-year policies, and what is the earning methodology?** — Multi-year (surety, warranty, inland marine) requires non-standard earning curves.
4. **How material are retrospective rating adjustments and audit premium?** — If >5% of GWP, must be in scope at go-live.
5. **How many PAS systems feed premium data, and are they being consolidated?** — Multiple PAS = multiple interfaces, multiple mapping exercises, potentially inconsistent data.

---

## PA-04: Loss & Claims Accounting

1. **How frequently does actuarial deliver IBNR/bulk reserve updates — quarterly, monthly?** — Determines interface frequency and close dependency. Monthly is a maturity indicator.
2. **At what granularity are actuarial reserve estimates posted — total company, by LOB, by LOB/accident year?** — More granularity = more useful for reporting but more reconciliation effort.
3. **Do your STAT and GAAP loss reserves differ for any LOBs, or are they currently identical?** — Identical = lower multi-basis complexity. Differences = additional adjustment entries.
4. **How is ULAE estimated and allocated to LOBs?** — Methodology affects allocation and IEE.
5. **Do you have asbestos, environmental, or latent liability reserves?** — These have separate estimation, teams, and reporting requirements.
6. **What is your current actuarial-to-accounting reconciliation process, and what breaks most often?** — Reveals real pain points. Answer is almost always "dimensional mapping and timing."

---

## PA-05: Ceded Reinsurance Accounting

1. **How many treaties and facultative certificates are in force, and how many reinsurers do you work with?** — Sizes the complexity. 10 treaties is simple; 200+ with 50+ reinsurers is complex.
2. **Do you use a dedicated reinsurance system, and is it being replaced?** — If replacing → FS-RI option. If retaining → interface. If spreadsheet-based today → major risk.
3. **How complex are your sliding-scale and profit commission formulas, and how frequently are they recalculated?** — Sliding-scale with loss ratio lookback is complex; requires projected loss ratio inputs.
4. **What is your current process for calculating ceded IBNR — separate actuarial estimate or factors applied to gross?** — Drives ceded reserve interface design and actuarial involvement.
5. **Do you have finite or non-traditional reinsurance contracts requiring risk transfer testing (FAS 113 / SSAP 62R)?** — Getting this wrong creates regulatory risk.
6. **What is your unauthorized reinsurance exposure, and how do you currently manage collateral?** — Drives collateral tracking and Schedule F penalty provision design.

---

## PA-07: Policyholder Liabilities & Reserves (Life/Annuity)

1. **How far along are you in LDTI implementation, and what system produces the LDTI numbers?** — Most carriers have implemented calculations; transformation question is GL interface and disclosure data.
2. **How many LDTI cohorts have you defined, and at what product grouping level?** — Number of cohorts drives volume, reconciliation effort, and reporting complexity.
3. **Do you have material variable annuity guarantees classified as market risk benefits?** — MRB requires fair value estimation; significant P&L volatility implications.
4. **What is your separate account to general account transfer process — daily or less frequent?** — Daily = operationally complex but standard for large VA writers.
5. **Are you planning any product-line exits or closed-block activities?** — Closed blocks have unique accounting requirements.

---

## PA-15: Financial Close & Consolidation

1. **What is your current close timeline (business days), and what is the target?** — Sets the transformation objective and identifies required bottleneck elimination.
2. **Which close activities are on the critical path?** — Almost always: actuarial reserve delivery, investment month-end, reinsurance month-end.
3. **How many manual journal entries per close, and what percentage could be automated?** — >200 manual entries is common; quantifies the automation opportunity.
4. **Do you close STAT and GAAP sequentially or in parallel?** — Sequential is traditional and lower risk; parallel is faster but requires more discipline.
5. **How many sub-ledger reconciliations do you perform, and which break most often?** — Identifies data quality issues to address. Claims-to-GL and PAS-to-GL are most common problem areas.
6. **Do pool settlements clear to zero within tolerance?** — If not, there are data quality or timing issues that must be resolved.

---

## PA-16: Statutory & Regulatory Reporting

1. **Which statutory reporting tool do you use today, and is it being replaced?** — Parallel workstream if replacing. Retained = must produce compatible data extracts.
2. **How automated is Schedule P production — system-generated or manually compiled triangles?** — Manual Schedule P is a major risk indicator. Migration can break historical continuity.
3. **How many states do you file in, and do any have supplemental requirements?** — NY, TX, FL in particular have state-specific supplements easy to miss.
4. **What is the data lineage from GL to each Annual Statement line item — is it documented?** — If not documented, creating it from scratch is a significant effort.
5. **Do you file combined or entity basis, and does the group include non-insurance entities?** — Affects consolidation and filing requirements.

---

## PA-18: Tax Accounting & Compliance

1. **What tax provision software do you use, and will it be retained?** — Data sourcing from new ERP is always scope; provision software is usually retained.
2. **How do you currently calculate Section 846 loss reserve discounting — system-based or spreadsheet?** — Spreadsheet-based is common and error-prone. Automation scope decision.
3. **What is your approach to Section 848 DAC tax — statutory line level calculation?** — Requires premium data by specified category; CoA and premium design must produce this.
4. **Do you have tax-exempt investment income, and how is proration handled?** — Section 832(b)(5) proration requires both investment and premium data from the new system.
5. **Are there anticipated tax law changes that should influence the design?** — Subchapter L modifications can invalidate design decisions.

---

## PA-20: Data Integration & Sub-Ledger Interfaces

1. **How many source systems currently feed the GL, and which are being replaced vs. retained?** — Sizes the integration scope. Retained = new interfaces; replaced = migration complexity.
2. **What is the current interface technology, and what is the target architecture?** — Flat file → real-time API is common objective; changes the timeline significantly.
3. **Which interfaces currently require manual reconciliation or intervention, and how often do they break?** — "The PAS interface requires 2 days of manual reconciliation monthly" = red flag requiring redesign.
4. **What is the desired frequency for each interface — daily, weekly, monthly?** — More frequent = better continuous close capability but more robust error handling required.
5. **Are there regulatory requirements around data lineage or auditability of interface data?** — SOX, state exam, ORSA governance may impose specific design constraints.
6. **What is the data conversion / historical data migration strategy?** — Historical data (especially 10-year Schedule P triangles) is the most underestimated workstream.

---

# SECTION 6: Process Complexity and Transformation Risk Matrix

| Process Area | Typical Complexity | Transformation Risk | Most Common Scope Trap | Insurance-Specific Risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PA-01: CoA & Org Structure | **High** | **High** | Underestimating LOB hierarchy complexity; not accommodating future state | STAT vs. GAAP leading ledger decision cascades to every other process; wrong choice is costly to reverse |
| PA-02: GL & Multi-Basis | **High** | **High** | Assuming GAAP adjustments are simple overlays when LDTI/IFRS 17 create fundamental measurement differences | FPSL vs. direct GL decision (SAP) is an irreversible architectural fork |
| PA-03: Premium Accounting | **High** | **High** | Treating premium like standard revenue; applying ASC 606 templates | FS-CD scope decision changes everything; if decided late, rework is massive |
| PA-04: Loss & Claims | **High** | **High** | Underscoping actuarial-to-GL interface as "just a journal entry feed" | Schedule P continuity through migration is a data integrity risk; reserve postings directly affect regulatory capital |
| PA-05: Ceded Reinsurance | **High** | **Very High** | Assuming reinsurance is a simple percentage of gross | FS-RI scope decision is high-cost/high-reward. Schedule F compliance requires reinsurer-level detail hard to retrofit |
| PA-06: Assumed Reinsurance | **High** | **High** | Underestimating bordereaux processing effort and data quality | Cedant reporting lag means reserves always estimated; methodology must be designed, not assumed |
| PA-07: Policyholder Liabilities | **Very High** | **Very High** | Treating LDTI as "done" and not scoping GL interface properly | LDTI cohort design affects amortization for decades; MRB fair value volatility creates P&L management challenges |
| PA-08: Investment Interface | **Medium-High** | **Medium** | Assuming investment system is out of scope when it's a dependency | Dual-basis investment accounting creates reconciliation complexity; IMR/AVR often missed |
| PA-09: AP & Commissions | **Medium** | **Medium** | Excluding commission system from scope, then discovering it's the agent's primary touchpoint | Agent master data governance unresolved; ERP, PAS, and commission system all claim system-of-record |
| PA-10: AR & Collections | **Medium-High** | **Medium-High** | Not deciding FS-CD scope early enough; forcing insurance premium into standard FI-AR | Agent balance netting and commission offset requires insurance-specific configuration |
| PA-11: Intercompany & Pooling | **High** | **High** | Treating pool accounting as "just intercompany" | Pool participation percentage changes create retroactive adjustments; timing of pool settlement vs. close is a process dependency |
| PA-12: Fixed Assets & Leases | **Low** | **Low** | Over-customizing when standard ERP works | Real estate investment accounting (Schedule A) falls between PA-08 and PA-12 with no clear owner |
| PA-13: Cash Management | **Medium** | **Medium** | Not integrating claims payment funding with catastrophe liquidity planning | Reinsurance collateral tracking requires treaty-level detail that standard treasury tools don't handle natively |
| PA-14: Expense Allocation | **High** | **High** | Starting IEE allocation design too late | IEE methodology subject to regulatory examination; surplus implications. Shared services allocation between insurance and non-insurance is a common audit finding |
| PA-15: Financial Close | **High** | **High** | Planning close without accounting for actuarial deliverable timing | Multi-basis close sequencing errors cascade. Continuous close objectives set without understanding sub-ledger dependencies |
| PA-16: Statutory Reporting | **Very High** | **Very High** | Assuming statutory tool "just works" with data from new ERP | Schedule P migration (10 years of accident year triangles) is the single highest data risk in insurance ERP transformations |
| PA-17: GAAP External Reporting | **Medium-High** | **Medium** | Treating GAAP reporting as simple trial balance extract when LDTI/IFRS 17 require sub-ledger data | AOCI volatility from investment portfolio can dwarf operating earnings |
| PA-18: Tax Accounting | **High** | **Medium-High** | Not sourcing Section 846/848 data requirements from CoA design | Loss reserve discounting factors change annually; DAC tax data requirements should influence premium accounting design |
| PA-19: Management Reporting | **Medium** | **Medium** | Building dashboards before underlying data model is stable | Actuarial vs. booked reserve variance reporting requires aligned dimensions across actuarial and accounting |
| PA-20: Data Integration | **High** | **Very High** | Underestimating interface count and complexity; not budgeting for reconciliation design | Every interface carries financial data that must reconcile to GL. Historical data migration for Schedule P is the single most underscoped workstream |
